QR Code Generator (Flask App)
Overview
This is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to generate QR codes. The app takes a URL (such as your GitHub profile link) as input, generates a QR code based on the URL, and displays it on the page. It uses the qrcode Python library to generate the QR code and Flask for the web framework.

Features
Generate QR Code: Users can input any URL (like their GitHub profile) and generate a corresponding QR code.
Flask-based: The web app is built with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
Base64 Encoding: The generated QR code is encoded as a Base64 string and displayed as an image on the webpage.

app.py
This file contains the main logic for the Flask app.
The app listens for GET and POST requests. When a URL is provided by the user, it generates a QR code using the qrcode library.
The QR code is then encoded into a Base64 string and passed to the HTML template for rendering.
index.html
The HTML template that displays the QR code generator form and shows the generated QR code when available.
style.css
The CSS file that styles the page, making the input form and generated QR code look clean and modern.
